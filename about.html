    <div class="about">
        <p>For most of my life I was working as a vegan chef. Don't get me wrong - I stil looove food but webdev is much more
            fun! When I decided to dive deeper into web development I started with studying at home (which is a rough path sometimes) but I succeded on making few projects from the scratch.
            <br><br>
            I consider myself a person who is dedicated to learning. Yeah, I know that sounds stiff but I'm not gonna lie, learning new stuff is giving me the rush of the rushes! I have my own routines,  and discipline is important so that helped me to study this topic by myself. But being a part of the team and learning from others is something what I miss, so 
            I'm very interested in internships or junior positions. 
            <br><br>
            If that sounds interesting and you would like to have a fika together - don't hesitate to contact me. 
            <br><br>
            Cheers!
        </p>
